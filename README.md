# SCARA-manipulator-Trajectory-Planning
The aim of this project is to compute the trajectory in the operational space. We consider the given points at the time stamps given with sample time Ts. The trajectory is generated using  the trapezoidal velocity profile. The total trajectory is completed in 3.4 seconds while considering the anticipation time.
